# Contact Management API

A backend API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage user and contact data securely and efficiently. The application follows REST API principles and integrates with **MongoDB** for data persistence using **Mongoose**. It features user authentication and authorization using **JWT tokens** and secure password hashing with **bcrypt**.

## Key Features:
- **User Management**: User registration, login, and secure token-based authentication.
- **Contact Management**: CRUD operations for contact records tied to authenticated users.
- **Secure Routes**: Middleware to protect endpoints and ensure data access is restricted to authenticated users.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with middleware for better debugging and user feedback.
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB schemas for users and contacts to maintain relationships and ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used:
- **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **Thunder Client** for API testing

This project is a robust example of building a scalable and secure backend API with modern web development practices.
